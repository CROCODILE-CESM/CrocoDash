# Grid Stuff (Supergrid, Bathymetry, Vgrid)

In CrocoDash, the first step is grid generation. CrocoDash directly wraps, with no modifications, mom6_bathy. Please pursue the [mom6_bathy documentation](https://ncar.github.io/mom6_bathy/) for all questions. There is no extra nuance to using CrocoDash grids, the only thing you need to is import the modules through CrocoDash.
