Driver Module
==================

This module wraps the regional-mom6, grid_gen, and regional-casegen classes, and contains configuration files read/write functions.

In it, we can initialize all these classes at once and save/read regional-mom6 experiments for fast development. Please see the AutoGenerated Docs for usage.
