# Shareable Configuration

Ever wanted to share your regional MOM6 setup? Get a summary of your unique changes? Let someone else easily run your model? This module is for you

Importable through `CrocoDash.shareable`, we've got a whole host of tools to do the following:

1. Identify the unique information in your CESM case (init args, forcing config, xml files, SourceMods, parameter changes)
2. Diff CrocoDash Cases
3. Bundle your unique CESM case information into a small zip folder
4. Interactively fork your CESM case bundle with different compset and configurations!

There is (or will be) a demo in the CrocoGallery for shareable configurations, please check it out!
