Demos
======

There are a few demos to get used to the CrocoDash. Check out the demos folder. Here is a few demos to get started with:

1. `minimal_demo_rect <demos/minimal_demo_rect.ipynb>`_. It creates a rectangular case from grid generation to CESM case submission. 

2. `minimal_demo_subset_global <demos/minimal_demo_subset_global.ipynb>`_, which is similar to the previous demo but subsets a global grid instead of generating a rectangular grid. 

3. `minimal_demo_three_boundary <demos/minimal_demo_three_boundary.ipynb>`_, showcases the ability to have less than four boundaries in a regional domain.
